I am <a href=\"https://drmayurkumargoyal.com/about-us\">Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal.</a> At my child care center, I see many children with seasonal flu. When your child is sick, it can be scary. This blog will help you understand the flu in simple words.</p><h3>What is the Seasonal Flu?</h3><p>The flu is an illness caused by a virus. It is not just a simple cold. It can make your child feel very tired and sick. Children get the flu more easily because their bodies are still learning to fight germs.</p><h3>What are the Signs of the Flu?</h3><p>How can you tell if it is the flu? Look for these signs:</p><ul><li><strong>High Fever:</strong> The body becomes very hot quickly.</li><li><strong>Body Pain:</strong> Your child may say their legs, arms, or back hurt.</li><li><strong>Cough and Cold:</strong> Usually a dry cough and runny nose.</li><li><strong>Feeling Very Tired:</strong> Your child may not want to play or eat.</li><li><strong>Chills:</strong> They may feel cold and shiver.</li></ul><h3>How to Help Your Child at Home</h3><p>Most children get better at home in a week. Here is what you can do:</p><ol><li><strong>Let Them Rest:</strong> Sleep helps the body fight the virus.</li><li><strong>Give Lots of Water:</strong> Make sure they drink water, soup, or ORS. This stops them from getting dry (dehydrated).</li><li><strong>For Fever:</strong> You can give medicine like Paracetamol. Always ask your doctor for the right dose for your child's age and weight.</li><li><strong>Make Them Comfortable:</strong> A humidifier or steam can help with a blocked nose.</li></ol><h3>When Should You Call the Doctor?</h3><p>Please call your doctor if you see:</p><ul><li>Fast breathing or problems breathing.</li><li>Not drinking any water or milk.</li><li>Your child is too sleepy or won't wake up properly.</li><li>The fever goes away and comes back.</li></ul><h3>How to Stop the Flu (Prevention)</h3><p>It is better to stop the flu than to treat it.</p><ol><li><strong>Flu Shot (Vaccine):</strong> This is the best way to protect your child. We recommend flu shots for children above 6 months.</li><li><strong>Wash Hands:</strong> Teach your child to wash hands with soap before eating.</li><li><strong>Stay Away from Sick People:</strong> Try to avoid crowds when the flu is common.</li></ol><h3>Final Advice</h3><p>Do not worry too much. The flu is common. With your love and care, most children get better. But if you are ever worried, please come see us. We are here to help.</p><p>Your child's health is our main goal.</p><p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href=\"https://drmayurkumargoyal.com/about-us\">Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal.</a></p><p><strong>Book Appointment:</strong> <a href=\"https://drmayur.academichub.in/OnlineAppointment.aspx\">https://drmayur.academichub.in/OnlineAppointment.aspx</a></p>",

    "content": "<h2>Understanding Pneumonia in Children: A Guide for Parents</h2><p>Hello parents. I am <strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong>. In my clinic, I meet many parents who are worried about pneumonia. I know this word can sound scary. But with good care, most children get well soon. This blog will help you understand pneumonia in simple words.</p><h3>What is Pneumonia?</h3><p>Pneumonia is a serious lung infection. The small air sacs in the lungs get filled with fluid or pus. This makes it hard for your child to breathe. It can be caused by germs like viruses or bacteria.</p><h3>What are the Signs of Pneumonia?</h3><p>It may start like a cold but gets worse. Look for these signs:</p><ul><li><strong>Bad Cough:</strong> Often with mucus (phlegm).</li><li><strong>Fast Breathing:</strong> Your child's breathing may become quick. You may see their chest moving a lot.</li><li><strong>Fever:</strong> Often a high fever.</li><li><strong>Chest Pain:</strong> Especially when coughing.</li><li><strong>Feeling Very Weak:</strong> Your child may not want to play at all.</li><li><strong>No Hunger:</strong> They may not want to eat or drink.</li></ul><h3>How to Help Your Child at Home</h3><p>If the doctor says it is okay to care for your child at home, you can do this:</p><ol><li><strong>Let Them Rest:</strong> Sleep helps the body fight the infection.</li><li><strong>Give Lots of Fluids:</strong> Offer water, soup, or ORS. This keeps them hydrated and loosens the mucus.</li><li><strong>For Fever:</strong> You can give medicine like Paracetamol. Always use the dose your doctor told you for your child's age and weight.</li><li><strong>Use a Humidifier:</strong> This adds moisture to the air and can help with coughing.</li></ol><p><strong>Very Important:</strong> If the doctor gave antibiotics, make sure your child takes all of it. Do not stop even if they feel better.</p><h3>When Should You Call the Doctor Immediately?</h3><p>Call your doctor right away or go to the hospital if you see:</p><ul><li><strong>Big trouble breathing.</strong> The skin between their ribs gets sucked in with each breath.</li><li><strong>Lips or nails turn blue.</strong></li><li><strong>A very high fever that won't go down.</strong></li><li><strong>Your child is too sleepy and hard to wake up.</strong></li><li><strong>No wet diapers or urine for many hours (dehydration).</strong></li></ul><h3>How to Stop Pneumonia (Prevention)</h3><p>It is better to prevent sickness than to treat it.</p><ol><li><strong>Vaccines (Shots):</strong> This is the best protection. Make sure your child gets all their needed shots on time.</li><li><strong>Wash Hands:</strong> Teach your child to wash hands with soap often.</li><li><strong>Healthy Food:</strong> Good food helps build a strong body to fight germs.</li><li><strong>Clean Air:</strong> Keep your child away from smoke and dust.</li></ol><h3>Final Advice</h3><p>Parents, please do not panic. Pneumonia is serious, but it can be treated. Your love and care are very important for your child's recovery. If you are ever worried, please come see me. I am here to help.</p><p>Your child's health is our main goal.</p><p><strong>Author:</strong> Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</p><p>📞 <strong>Call:</strong> <a href=\"tel:+918955966990\">+91 8955966990</a></p><p>📍 <strong>Clinic:</strong> Near Lions Club, Vaishali Nagar, Ajmer</p><p>🌐 <strong>Book Online:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/\">www.drmayurkumargoyal.com</a></p>",

Don't worry. <strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong>, a child specialist, explains the common causes, symptoms, and when you should see a doctor.</p><p>Hello, I am <strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong>. I am a Pediatrician and Neonatologist. Every day, I meet many worried parents who get scared when they see a rash on their child's skin.</p><p>I have only one request for you: <strong>\"Please don't panic!\"</strong></p><p>A child's skin is very soft and sensitive. Getting rashes is very common. Most of the time, these rashes go away on their own or with simple care. Today, I will explain the reasons for these rashes and what you should do.</p><h3>1. Why Do Rashes Happen?</h3><p>There are many reasons for rashes in children. Here are the most common ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Infections:</strong> Viral fevers, chickenpox, measles, dengue, or fungal infections.</li><li><strong>Allergies:</strong> From new foods, medicines, soap, lotion, or detergent used for washing clothes.</li><li><strong>Heat or Sweat:</strong> Prickly heat (ghamoriya) or diaper rash.</li><li><strong>Skin Problems:</strong> Like eczema.</li></ul><h3>2. How to Understand the Rash?</h3><p>Rashes can look different. Please notice these things:</p><ul><li><strong>Type of Rash:</strong> Are they small red spots, water-filled blisters, or big patches?</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> Where is the rash? Is it all over the body, only on the stomach, or near the joints?</li><li><strong>Fever:</strong> Does your child have a fever? Did the fever come before or after the rash?</li><li><strong>Itching:</strong> Is the child restless and trying to scratch the rash?</li><li><strong>Colour:</strong> What is the colour of the rash? Red, pink, or white?</li></ul><p>Knowing the answers to these questions helps me understand the problem better.</p><h3>3. What Can You Do at Home?</h3><p>If the rash is mild and your child is otherwise active and healthy, you can try these tips:</p><ul><li>Dress your child in loose, soft, and cotton clothes.</li><li>Keep the skin clean and dry. Avoid very hot water for bathing.</li><li>For itching, you can use an ice pack. You can also give an anti-allergy medicine suggested by your doctor.</li><li>Do not use any new soap, lotion, or food for the child.</li><li>Keep your child hydrated. Give them plenty of water and fluids.</li></ul><h3>4. When Should You See a Doctor?</h3><p>Most rashes are not dangerous. But, you must contact a doctor immediately if you see any of these signs:</p><ul><li>High fever (more than 101°F) with the rash.</li><li>The rash is spreading very fast all over the body.</li><li>The rash is purple in colour or if there is bleeding from the rash.</li><li>The child is very weak, vomiting, or has difficulty breathing.</li><li>The itching is very severe and the child cannot sleep.</li></ul><p>It is natural for parents to worry in such situations. But remember, getting a doctor's advice at the right time is the best solution.</p><h3>5. Final Words</h3><p>As a parent, I understand your worry. But with a little knowledge and the right steps, you can help your child feel better soon. When you see a rash, first stay calm. Try to understand the symptoms. If you see any serious signs, contact your doctor without delay.</p><p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

    "content": "<h2>Diarrhoea in Children: A Complete Guide for Parents</h2><p>Hello, dear parents. I am <strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/about-us\" title=\"About Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal\">child specialist in Ajmer</a>. At my clinic, <strong><a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com\" title=\"Mayur Childern Hospital\">Mayur Childern Hospital</a></strong>, one of the most common problems I see in children is diarrhoea, which we often call loose motions.</p><p>As a parent, it is heartbreaking to see your child unwell and unable to tell you what exactly is wrong. I see your worry, and I want to help. This guide will explain everything you need to know about diarrhoea in a simple way.</p><h3>What Exactly is Diarrhoea?</h3><p>Diarrhoea means passing loose or watery stools three or more times a day. It happens when germs (like viruses or bacteria) irritate your child's stomach and intestines. While it is the body's way of getting rid of the germs, it also causes the loss of vital water and salts from the body.</p><h3>Why is Diarrhoea Dangerous for Children?</h3><p>The biggest and most serious problem diarrhoea can cause is <strong>dehydration</strong>. This means your child's body loses more fluid than it takes in. Young children can become dehydrated very quickly, which can become serious if not treated.</p><h3>How to Spot Dehydration: Important Signs for Parents</h3><p>You are the first person who can see if your child is getting dehydrated. Please look for these signs:</p><ul><li><strong>Passing less urine:</strong> Fewer wet nappies than usual. For a baby, less than 6 wet nappies in 24 hours is a warning sign. For an older child, if they don't pass urine for 6-8 hours, be alert.</li><li><strong>Dry mouth and tongue:</strong> The inside of the mouth will look and feel dry, not wet and shiny.</li><li><strong>No tears while crying:</strong> When your child cries, especially a baby, no tears come out.</li><li><strong>Sunken eyes:</strong> The eyes may look deep and have dark circles.</li><li><strong>Unusual behaviour:</strong> Your child may become very tired, weak, drowsy, or extremely irritable and fussy.</li><li><strong>Cold hands and feet:</strong> The skin may feel cool to the touch.</li></ul><h3>Dr. Mayur's Home Care Advice: What to Do When Your Child Has Diarrhoea</h3><p>For mild cases, you can successfully care for your child at home by following these steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Focus on Fluids, Not Food:</strong> The most important thing is to keep your child hydrated.<ul><li><strong>For Babies:</strong> Please continue breastfeeding or formula feeding. You can also give Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) between feeds. Breast milk is the best medicine.</li><li><strong>For Older Children:</strong> Give small sips of ORS frequently. You can also offer buttermilk (chaas), lentil water (dal ka pani), or coconut water. ORS is the best as it replaces the lost salts perfectly.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Offer Gentle Foods:</strong> Once your child is taking fluids well, you can offer small amounts of easy-to-digest food.<ul><li>Good choices are khichdi, plain rice with curd, banana, apple sauce, or boiled potatoes.</li><li>Remember the new rule: \"Feed a gut infection.\" Giving food helps the intestine heal.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Keep Them Clean and Comfortable:</strong><ul><li>Let your child rest as much as possible.</li><li>If your child wears diapers, change them immediately after every loose stool. Use a good barrier cream like zinc oxide to prevent a painful nappy rash. For persistent issues, learn about <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/newborn-care/diaper-rash-treatment\" title=\"Diaper Rash Treatment\">diaper rash treatment</a>.</li></ul></li></ol><h3>When You Must Call Your Child Doctor in Ajmer: The Danger Signs</h3><p>Please do not wait if you see any of the following signs. Call me immediately.</p><ul><li>You see signs of dehydration (as listed above).</li><li>Blood or mucus in the stool.</li><li>High fever that does not come down.</li><li>Frequent vomiting and inability to keep any liquids down.</li><li>Severe stomach pain that doesn't go away.</li><li>Your child becomes very lethargic, floppy, or difficult to wake up.</li></ul><p>For urgent cases, don't hesitate to visit our <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/services/pediatrics-emergency-services\" title=\"Pediatrics Emergency Services\">emergency services</a>.</p><h3>What You Should Avoid Doing</h3><ul><li>Do not give sugary drinks like cola, packaged fruit juices, or sweetened sports drinks. They can make the diarrhoea worse.</li><li>Do not give any adult anti-diarrhoea medicines to your child. They can be dangerous for children.</li><li>Do not stop breastfeeding or formula milk.</li></ul><h3>My Final Words to You</h3><p>Dear parents, I know how anxious you feel when your child is sick. My best advice is to trust your instincts. You know your child better than anyone else. If you feel that something is not right, even if you are not sure, please do not hesitate. It is always better to be safe and call your doctor. A quick conversation can ease your worry and set you on the right path.</p><p>My door and phone are always open for you. Let's work together to keep your little ones healthy and happy.</p><p>With warm regards,</p><p><strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong><br>Consultant Pediatrician & Neonatologist</p><h3>My Clinic in Ajmer:</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com\" title=\"Mayur Childern Hospital\">Mayur Childern Hospital</a></strong></p><ul><li>Monday to Saturday: 9 AM - 12:30 PM and 5 PM - 8:30 PM</li><li>Sunday: 10 AM - 2 PM</li></ul><p>📞 <strong>Call for Appointment:</strong> +91 90249 88677, +91 89559 66990</p><p>🌐 <strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://drmayurkumargoyal.com/\">https://drmayurkumargoyal.com/</a></p><p>For more helpful articles on child health, check out our <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog\" title=\"Child Health Blog\">blog page</a> with topics like <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/healthy-digestion-kids-tips-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Healthy Digestion Tips\">digestion problems in children</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/prevent-childhood-illnesses-tips-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Prevent Childhood Illnesses\">preventing childhood illnesses</a>.</p>",

I am <strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong>, your <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/about-us\" title=\"About Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal\">child specialist in Ajmer</a>. At <strong><a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com\" title=\"Mayur Childern Hospital\">Mayur Childern Hospital</a></strong>, I often meet worried parents whose children are suffering from a Urine Tract Infection, or UTI.</p><p>It can be confusing when a young child has a fever or seems uncomfortable but can't tell you where it hurts. I understand your concern. This guide will help you understand what a UTI is and what you can do.</p><h3>What is a Urine Tract Infection (UTI)?</h3><p>A UTI is an infection in any part of the system that handles our urine (pee). This includes the kidneys, the tubes connecting them (ureters), the bladder, and the tube that passes urine out of the body (urethra). It happens when germs, usually bacteria, get into this system and cause an infection.</p><h3>Why Do Children Get UTIs?</h3><p>Germs from the skin or stool can sometimes find their way into the urinary tract. This is more common in girls because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. In babies, wearing a soiled diaper for too long can also sometimes increase the risk.</p><h3>How to Spot a UTI: Important Signs for Parents</h3><p>It can be tricky, especially with young children who can't talk. Please look for these signs:</p><ul><li><strong>Fever:</strong> Often the only sign in a baby, especially if it has no clear cause like a cold or cough.</li><li><strong>Pain or Burning:</strong> An older child may complain of pain or a burning feeling when they urinate.</li><li><strong>Stomach Pain or Discomfort:</strong> Your child may have pain in the lower belly or back.</li><li><strong>Urgent Need to Go:</strong> They may feel a sudden, strong need to urinate, often passing only a few drops.</li><li><strong>Going Too Often:</strong> Needing to urinate much more often than usual.</li><li><strong>Bedwetting:</strong> A child who is usually dry at night might start wetting the bed again.</li><li><strong>Foul-Smelling or Cloudy Urine:</strong> The urine may look cloudy or smell bad.</li><li><strong>Being Fussy:</strong> Babies might be unusually irritable, cry during nappy changes, or feed poorly.</li></ul><h3>Dr. Mayur's Advice: What to Do If You Suspect a UTI</h3><p>If you notice any of the signs above, here is what you should do:</p><ol><li><strong>See a Doctor:</strong> The most important step is to bring your child to the clinic. UTIs need proper medical diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics prescribed by a doctor.</li><li><strong>Get a Urine Test:</strong> We will need a small sample of your child's urine to confirm the infection. I will guide you on how to collect it correctly.</li><li><strong>Give the Full Course of Medicine:</strong> If your child is prescribed antibiotics, it is very important to finish the entire course, even if they start feeling better. This ensures the infection is completely gone.</li><li><strong>Offer Plenty of Fluids:</strong> Encourage your child to drink more water. This helps flush out the bacteria from their system.</li></ol><h3>When You Must Call Your Child Doctor in Ajmer</h3><p>Please do not wait if you see any of the following signs. Call me immediately.</p><ul><li>Your baby under 3 months has a fever.</li><li>Your child has a high fever with chills.</li><li>They have severe pain in the back or stomach.</li><li>They are vomiting and cannot keep medicine down.</li><li>They seem very weak, drowsy, or difficult to wake up.</li></ul><p>For urgent cases, don't hesitate to visit our <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/services/pediatrics-emergency-services\" title=\"Pediatrics Emergency Services\">emergency services</a>.</p><h3>What You Should Avoid Doing</h3><ul><li>Do not give leftover antibiotics from an old illness.</li><li>Do not ignore the symptoms, thinking they will go away on their own.</li><li>Do not give sugary drinks or cola; water is the best choice.</li></ul><h3>My Final Words to You</h3><p>Dear parents, a UTI is a common childhood illness that can be treated effectively. The key is to notice the signs early and get the right treatment. As always, trust your instincts. You know your child best. If you feel something is wrong, please reach out. A quick check-up can give you peace of mind and get your child back to good health.</p><p>My door and phone are always open for you. Let's work together to keep your little ones healthy and happy.</p><p>With warm regards,</p><p><strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong><br>Consultant Pediatrician & Neonatologist</p><h3>My Clinic in Ajmer:</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com\" title=\"Mayur Childern Hospital\">Mayur Childern Hospital</a></strong></p><ul><li>Near Lions Club, Vaishali Nagar, Ajmer</li><li>Monday to Saturday: 9 AM - 12:30 PM and 5 PM - 8:30 PM</li><li>Sunday: 10 AM - 2 PM</li></ul><p><strong>PARAS UROLOGY & MULTISPECIALITY</strong></p><ul><li>Monday to Saturday: 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM</li><li>Sunday: Closed</li></ul><p>📞 <strong>Call for Appointment:</strong> +91 90249 88677, +91 89559 66990</p><p>🌐 <strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://drmayurkumargoyal.com/\">https://drmayurkumargoyal.com/</a></p><p>For more helpful articles on child health, check out our <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog\" title=\"Child Health Blog\">blog page</a> with topics like <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/diarrhoea-in-children-complete-guide-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Diarrhoea in Children Guide\">diarrhoea in children</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/seasonal-flu-children-symptoms-treatment-prevention\" title=\"Seasonal Flu Guide\">seasonal flu in children</a>.</p>",

Let's Understand Colic Together</h2><p><strong>A Quick Note from Dr. Mayur:</strong></p><p>Hi there, I'm <strong><a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/about-us\" title=\"About Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal\">Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</a></strong>. In my clinic, <strong><a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com\" title=\"Mayur Childern Hospital\">Mayur Childern Hospital</a></strong> in Ajmer, I meet many tired and worried parents with the same story: \"Doctor, my healthy baby cries for hours, and we can't calm him down.\"</p><p>If you feel this way, you are not alone. Let's talk about what this might be and what you can do.</p><h3>What is Colic, Really?</h3><p>Think of colic as a time when a healthy baby cries a lot for no clear reason.</p><p>It's like a daily puzzle. The crying often happens in the evening and can feel unstoppable. The good news? It is temporary and usually goes away on its own in a few months.</p><h3>Spotting the Signs: Is it Colic?</h3><p>Here's what you might see in a baby with colic:</p><ul><li><strong>Long Crying Spells:</strong> Intense crying that can last for 1-3 hours, often at the same time every day.</li><li><strong>Body Clues:</strong> They may pull their legs up to their tummy, clench their fists, or their face may turn red.</li><li><strong>Hard to Comfort:</strong> Your usual tricks like feeding or rocking don't seem to work during this time.</li></ul><h3>Soothing Your Baby: What Can You Try?</h3><p>There is no single magic solution, but you can try these simple ideas:</p><h4>1. Comforting Touch:</h4><ul><li>Gently rub your baby's back.</li><li>Hold them against your chest so they can hear your heartbeat.</li><li>Try a warm (not hot) water bottle on their tummy over their clothes.</li></ul><h4>2. Gentle Motion:</h4><ul><li>Rock them gently in your arms.</li><li>Take them for a slow walk in a stroller.</li><li>A calm car ride can sometimes work wonders.</li></ul><h4>3. Calming Sounds:</h4><ul><li>Sing a soft lullaby or play gentle music.</li><li>The steady hum of a fan or washing machine can be soothing.</li></ul><h4>4. Feeding Check:</h4><ul><li>If you bottle-feed, make sure your baby isn't swallowing too much air. Try a different bottle if needed.</li><li>Always burp your baby well after every feed. For more guidance on <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/newborn-care/enough-food\" title=\"Newborn Feeding Guide\">newborn feeding</a>, visit our resources.</li></ul><h3>A Very Important Message for YOU, the Parent</h3><p>Listening to a crying baby for hours is hard. It can make you feel stressed and helpless.</p><p>Please remember: <strong>It is okay to take a break.</strong></p><p>If you feel overwhelmed, place your baby safely in their crib and step away for a few minutes. Take some deep breaths. Ask your partner or a family member for help. Taking care of yourself is not selfish; it is necessary.</p><h3>When Should You Call Your Doctor?</h3><p>Colic is common, but it's important to be sure it's just colic. Please call me at my clinic if you see any of these signs:</p><ul><li><strong>Fever</strong> of 100.4ºF or more.</li><li><strong>Vomiting</strong> (especially green or forceful vomiting).</li><li><strong>Your baby</strong> is very weak, too sleepy, or difficult to wake up.</li><li><strong>No wet diapers</strong> for over 6-8 hours - this could indicate <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/diarrhoea-in-children-complete-guide-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Dehydration in Children\">dehydration</a>.</li><li><strong>Blood</strong> in the stool.</li><li><strong>They are not gaining weight.</strong></li></ul><p>If you notice any of these <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/newborn-danger-signs-sick-baby-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Newborn Danger Signs\">danger signs</a>, don't hesitate to visit our <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/services/pediatrics-emergency-services\" title=\"Pediatrics Emergency Services\">emergency services</a>.</p><h3>My Final Word to You</h3><p>Dear parents, you are doing a great job.

    "content": "<h2>Dengue Fever in Children: A Simple Guide for Parents</h2><p>Hello, dear parents. I am <strong>Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal</strong>, your <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/about-us\" title=\"About Dr. Mayur Kumar Goyal\">child specialist in Ajmer</a>. At <strong><a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com\" title=\"Mayur Childern Hospital\">Mayur Childern Hospital</a></strong>, I often meet concerned parents during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons when cases of Dengue fever are on the rise.</p><p>It can be frightening to see your child unwell with high fever and body pain, especially when you hear about Dengue in the news. I understand your worry. This guide will help you understand what Dengue is, how to recognize it, and what steps you should take to protect your child.</p><h3>What is Dengue Fever?</h3><p>Dengue is a viral illness spread by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. This mosquito usually bites during the daytime, especially in the early morning and late afternoon. Dengue cannot spread directly from one person to another.</p><h3>Why Are Children More Vulnerable?</h3><p>Children, especially younger ones, are more vulnerable because their immune systems are still developing. They often play outdoors, making them more exposed to mosquito bites if proper precautions are not taken.</p><h3>How to Spot Dengue: Important Signs for Parents</h3><p>The symptoms of Dengue can vary from mild to severe. Please watch for these signs:</p><ul><li><strong>High Fever:</strong> A sudden, high-grade fever (104°F or 40°C) is often the first sign. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/prevent-childhood-illnesses-tips-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Childhood Fever Management\">managing fever in children</a>.</li><li><strong>Severe Body Aches:</strong> Your child may complain of severe pain in muscles and joints. This is why Dengue is sometimes called \"breakbone fever.\"</li><li><strong>Pain Behind the Eyes:</strong> This is a classic symptom of Dengue.</li><li><strong>Severe Headache:</strong> Often accompanied by eye pain.</li><li><strong>Skin Rash:</strong> A red rash may appear a few days after the fever starts. For more on <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/child-skin-rashes-causes-treatment-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Child Skin Rashes Guide\">skin rashes in children</a>, read our detailed guide.</li><li><strong>Nausea and Vomiting:</strong> Your child may feel nauseous or vomit frequently.</li><li><strong>Mild Bleeding:</strong> Look for signs like nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or easy bruising.</li><li><strong>Lethargy and Weakness:</strong> Your child may seem unusually tired, weak, or restless.</li></ul><h3>Dr. Mayur's Advice: What to Do If You Suspect Dengue</h3><p>If you notice any of the signs above, here is what you should do:</p><ol><li><strong>See a Doctor Immediately:</strong> Early diagnosis and management are crucial. Bring your child to the clinic for a proper evaluation. Book a consultation at our <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/services/general-pediatrics-opd\" title=\"General Pediatrics OPD\">General Pediatrics OPD</a>.</li><li><strong>Get a Blood Test:</strong> A simple blood test (like NS1 Antigen or Dengue Serology) can confirm the infection. I will advise you on the right test and timing.</li><li><strong>Keep Your Child Hydrated:</strong> Encourage plenty of fluids – water, oral rehydration solution (ORS), coconut water, or clear soups. Good hydration is the most important part of treatment. For dehydration concerns, read about <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/diarrhoea-in-children-complete-guide-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Diarrhoea and Dehydration Guide\">dehydration in children</a>.</li><li><strong>Manage Fever:</strong> Give only Paracetamol for fever and pain. <strong>Avoid medicines like Ibuprofen, Aspirin, or other NSAIDs, as they can increase the risk of bleeding.</strong></li><li><strong>Ensure Rest:</strong> Let your child rest as much as possible to help their body recover.</li></ol><h3>When You Must Call Your Child Doctor in Ajmer: The Warning Signs</h3><p>Dengue can become serious quickly. Please do not wait if you see any of the following warning signs. Call me immediately.</p><ul><li>Severe abdominal pain or persistent vomiting.</li><li>Bleeding from the nose or gums, or blood in vomit or stool.</li><li>Your child is very lethargic, restless, or difficult to wake.</li><li>Cold, clammy hands and feet, or pale skin.</li><li>Difficulty in breathing.</li></ul><p>For urgent cases, don't hesitate to visit our <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/services/pediatrics-emergency-services\" title=\"Pediatrics Emergency Services\">emergency services</a>. If symptoms are severe, we also provide <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/services/pediatric-critical-care\" title=\"Pediatric Critical Care\">pediatric critical care</a>.</p><h3>What You Should Avoid Doing</h3><ul><li><strong>Do not self-medicate.</strong> Avoid Aspirin and Ibuprofen.</li><li>Do not ignore warning signs, thinking it's just a viral fever.</li><li>Do not give dark-colored drinks or sodas. Stick to clear fluids.</li><li>Do not delay seeking medical advice.</li></ul><h3>Prevention is Key: Protect Your Child from Mosquitoes</h3><p>The best way to fight Dengue is to prevent it. Especially during the Dengue season:</p><ul><li><strong>Prevent Mosquito Breeding:</strong> Empty stagnant water from coolers, flower pots, old tyres, and any containers around your home.</li><li><strong>Use Mosquito Protection:</strong> Use mosquito nets, repellents, and dress your child in full-sleeved clothes when outdoors.</li><li><strong>Keep Windows and Doors Screened:</strong> Install nets to prevent mosquitoes from entering your home.</li><li><strong>Vaccinate:</strong> While there's no specific Dengue vaccine for all children yet, keeping up with general <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/services/vacination-programs\" title=\"Vaccination Programs\">vaccination schedules</a> helps maintain overall immunity.</li></ul><p>For more <a href=\"https://www.drmayurkumargoyal.com/blog/prevent-childhood-illnesses-tips-ajmer-pediatrician\" title=\"Preventing Childhood Illnesses\">tips on preventing childhood illnesses</a>, visit our blog.</p><h3>My Final Words to You</h3><p>Dear parents, while Dengue can be serious, most children recover well with timely and proper medical care.
